# url_shortener
 created by Janay Peters in the Web Design and Development program at Full Sail University.

# Purpose
 The purpose of this url shortener is to allow the user to enter a regular url and it return a unique shortend url.

# Installation Process
 Click the green button that says, "clone or Download" above on the right.
 After you have cloned or downloaded the application you will then need to open up your terminal and download a few things!<br/>

 First: Install npm by typing "npm install"
 Second: Install nodemon by typing "npm install nodemon"
 Third: Start the server by typing "node src/server.js"

# My Endpoints
POST /api/v1/urls
    A shortened URL should appear in Postman, I haven't quite figured out how to get it to show up on my html page.
